# jsr305-extended
---
As java 9 does not allow the use of the javax package for annotations anymore I decided to create my own jsr305 implementation.

In this a few annotations (mainly the Nonnull, CheckForNull, Nullable and ParametersAreNonnull/NullableByDefault) are inspired by common jsr305 implementations while others are defined as additional ones.

## Note
As I consider this project finished, there will likely be no further development
